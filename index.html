        <h2>"Chocolate in three forms!!!"</h2>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups good quality gluten-free flour blend</li>
                <li>1/2 cup baking cocoa</li>
                <li>2 tsp. baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
                <li>16 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chunks or chips</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>  
                <li>1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum (oomit if using a flour blend with xanthan or guar gum)</li>
                <li>10 Tbsp. salted butter, room temp.</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>   
            </ul>
        <p>Directions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, xanthan gum, cocoa, baking powder and salt. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Melt the semi-sweet chocolate chunks or chips in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring after each. Once melted completely, set aside to cool a bit.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of your stand mixer, beat the butter at medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 45 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>Beat in the sugars until combined, about 45 seconds. The mixture will look granular.</li>
                <li>Reduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the eggs and vanilla until incorporated, about 45 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add the melted chocolate in a stream and beat until combined, about 1 minute. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients mixture and mix just until combined. Do not overmix! Stir in the additional chocolate chips.</li>
                <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature about 20-30 minutes. The dough consistency will become more fudge-like. You can skip this step, but your cookies will spread more during baking if you bake them right away.</li>
                <li>Whatever you do, do NOT put the dough in the refrigerator! It will harden like concrete!</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Line 2 sheets with parchment paper. Use a medium cookie/ice-cream scoop, rounded. My cookie dough balls weighed 1-1.25 oz. each, if that helps you!</li>
                <li>Scoop 12 cookies per large cookie sheet. You should have enough dough for about 3 1/2 dozen cookies.</li>
                <li>Bake each cookie sheet for 12 minutes or until the edges of the cookies have just begun to set but the centers are still very soft. If baking two pans at once, be sure to rotate the pans front to back and top shelf to bottom shelf partway through the baking time. I prefer baking one pan at a time for best results.</li>
                <li>Cool the cookies on the sheets about 5 minutes or until set, then transfer to cooling racks.</li>
                <li>Enjoy with a glass of milk!</li>
